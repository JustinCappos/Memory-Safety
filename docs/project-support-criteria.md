# OpenSSF Memory Safety Project Support Program

NOTE - This is currently a draft and this program has not been launched yet!

[The OpenSSF TAC/Foundation is currently working on a funding model and process](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/pull/13#issuecomment-1791255657) for supporting project/efforts related to Open Source Software Security.

This Working Group is focused specifically on how to technically evaluate a project/effort related to improving memory safety in Open Source Software.

## Draft Criteria

Does this project meaningfully improve memory safety within Open Source software [according to our definition of memory safety](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/blob/main/docs/definitions.md)?

Meaningful efforts include (but are not limited to):

* Targeted re-write efforts of Open Source software in memory safe by default languages
* Educational efforts on memory safety in software
* Tools/Processes which improve the memory safety of software when a rewrite in a memory safe by default language is not possible/practical
* Efforts which reduce undefined behavior (related to memory safety) in commonly used Open Source software components
